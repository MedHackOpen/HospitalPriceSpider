# MedHack Hospital Price CSVs

## These CSV files have been converted from their original format (.xls, .csv) to CSV. Additionally, many originally contained headers at the top that make the CSVs unconvertable to JSON/SQL which is neccasssary for them to be machine-readable. This repo aims to contain all of the files in their original format (minus the headers) and other trash that makes them unreadable.

There is no uniform way that hospitals are required to report this; therefore in the conversionRules folder in the parent directory, there is a mapping JSON that contains the appropriate mapping between feilds to the new standard format we are using (which just makes sense, and hopefulyl can be adopted as THE format, so developers can make tools with this aggregated data, and it's not a complete mad house like it is now.)
